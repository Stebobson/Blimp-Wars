about controlling either a single blimp or an army of blimps (perhaps two different game modes?)
modes:
  campaign (battle sets of blimps based on a storyline, with bosses scattered in)
  waves (enemies come in waves, with bosses at set points)
  multiplayer? (teams/free for all, battling)
stats system (to be improved): health and safety (defense); quality of material (health); number of engineers (regeneration); engine power (horizontal speed); inflation (vertical speed + size); firepower (damage)
blimps have unspecified weak points; need to be discovered manually
bosses:
  size changing
  flamethrowers (extra damage)
enemies:
  boss blimps
  boss aircraft carrier (emits enemies)
  planes (fire low-damage bullets; circle round as they pass to make killing them worth your time; chance of flying into you; low health)
  birds (fly towards you, do damage if they hit a vehicle (especially planes) scared by shooting; low health)
  hot air balloons (use random weapons (metronome); high health; slow)

Yes.
